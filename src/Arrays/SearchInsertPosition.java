        Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
        Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
        Output: 2

        Example 2:
        Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
        Output: 1

        Example 3:
        Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
        Output: 4

        int[] nums = {1, 3, 5, 6};
        int target = 5;
        System.out.println(searchInsert(nums, target)); // Output: 2
    }
    public static int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (target == nums[mid]) {
                return mid;
            } else if (target > nums[mid]){
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
        /*
        Now, left = 1, right = 0 â€” left has crossed right, this means target is not in nums, and left is the position where target would fit to keep the array sorted
         */
